On the home stretch but I am not anywhere near where I would like to be.

Today - try and exercise as written and then try to apply it as I would have used it in the diss. Part of assessing what I could do differently.

Have successfully used wget. Will try the command to get a copy of Canadian Printer and Publisher. The site is set up for downloading an entire issue in whatever format one wants. So wget not necessary if I wanted just a few issues which applied in my case as I wanted specific issues. But a test case. The lack of potential targets for me to work wget on indicates to me a major drawback for my work - the sources simply were not out there on the net. 
Made directory in DH "PrinterPublisher"  and cd into it. Decided to try to pull the first 20 of the 570 pages available.
Error - Not finished and then accidently kicked myself out of dhbox so lost the history. Google search indicated the % dominates so it appears the system read so far and then could not go to the next step - a syntax error

Went onto binder and once I read the getting started file, go started
Straightforward step and click run
Thought about what term I could substitute - Good Roads or Cheese Exporters. Not sure what I would do with the mass of material that would result. Had to quit at this point so will have to come back to it.
