Week 4 and I am still unable to accomplish the exercises from week 3. I have spent the week till now working on other projects except for Monday when I read week 4's assigned readings.

Goal for this week is all about last week - 1) open a nano file in edit mode rather than read-only; 2) follow Mulligan's tutorial again for the 4th time! and try again! to do wget on activehistories; 3) get a template that looks like the workbook example for textwrangler; TEI a page from the anti-slavery pamphlet.

#*Goal 1*#
Review Nano for Dummies ie., Beginners Guide in How to Geek
Was I opening it correctly as I do not remember inserting "to" between path and filename'ie., *not* home/wh-1-history but home/to/dhbox-work-today.md Got message no such file.
Tried ctl-O to open a file. Still read only
