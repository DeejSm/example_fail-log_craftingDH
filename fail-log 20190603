  Finally the light dawned that perhaps the fault lay not in my computers, but in myself - that is, perhaps I had not read the dhbox instructions correctly in week 1 and had gone in the wrong door of the on-campus portal rather than the off-campus portal. I experimented by opening a second dhbox via vpn and tried to use it with nano and wget. All now beautiful. It seems it is possible to open up the on-campus dhbox entrypoint from off-campus but you cannot actually do much with it.
  
  Now that I have a working dhbox I did the Milligan tutorial and then went on to download the war diary. As seen below this was straight-forward copy what I saw in the guide into the command line and voila!
  
  1  urls = '';
    2  f=open('urls.txt','w')
    3  for x in range(8029, 8110):
    4  f.close
    5  ls
    6  nano urls.py
    7  python urls.py
    8  ls
    9  nano urls.txt
   10  wget -1 urls.txt - r --no-parent -nd -w 2 --limit-rate=100k
   11  wget -i urls.txt -r --no-parent -nd -w 2 --limit-rate=100k
   12  ls
   13  history
   14  history > dhbox-wk-history-2_2.md
   
   I have not annotated this week. I discussed my areas of interest with Dr. Graham and we agreed I would focus on the modules for cleaning and using data now that I have wget working.
