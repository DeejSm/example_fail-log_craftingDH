# Week 1 fail log
Actually I would call it a terrible week. With a lot of extra computer time required at work for an urgent research requirement which involved more staring at a screen than usual my problem eye has been blurring badly.I also never mananged to get consecutive time for the course this week despite my original scheduling of a day for readings and thinking and then another day of whatever I have to do after than.  And I cannot say I did well on setting up all these spaces. I did not recognize the highlighting as links for quite a while. I finally accepted I had to print everything out to work this week. My biggest problem is in Hypothesis which in itself is not a problem. But it seems to be just luck when I am able to get out of the public sphere and into the HIST group sphere to record annotations.

I have not yet solved this problem of finding the group space. The readings are interesting but because I ended up having to print them to read them and annotate the old-fashioned way, its been awkward.
