#modules 2 and 3 using documents from the Ottawa Valley Journal#

In Finder Made a duplicate of 4 and dragged it to my folder "Digital History" on my mac.
Opened file in Preview and deleted all but two pages with rural content.
Saved file. Duplicate and opened each in Preview to make 2 files of 1 page each.
Exported a file to jpeg
Dragged the files onto dhbox home/deejsmith/

Step 1 Tesseract
Followed lines 1 to 4 to import into dhbox tesseract and image magic
line 5
Had to redo the image magic - to get it to work, suspect no sudo as I was not asked for password first time

tried to pull in the newspaper file and went nowhere. Ince bvecause of bad typing and once because I have no idea
instead did the command exactly as laid out in the module to bring in a war diary file. This time no hiccups but no action. The module said be patient. I was patient but the computer timed out instead.
